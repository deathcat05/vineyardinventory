This was a project created during my Database Management Systems class Spring of 2017. We were given the option to create a database for anything we wanted, and I chose to do a vineyard management system. I chose to continue working on this project after the semester ended.  I fixed the UI over the summer, advancing my skills in HTML and CSS. Right now, my focus is trying to integrate OAuth using Passprot.j and MongoDB. The entire web application is ongoing when I have time between classwork. 



##### NOTES ABOUT PROJECT ######

The following things are implemented in my database, but not outputting to the webpage: 

(1) The BoughtRed table is not properly implemented, and the BoughtWhite table is not implemented at all. However, it does not take away from the current functionality of the webpage.

(2) Authentication is not integrated yet.
